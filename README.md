# QiskitMetal Hackathon Korea 2021
#### Our team challenged to target properties such as Qubit frequency, Readout frequency, Bus frequency, Coupling strength(g), Anharmonicity(E~c~), Q~ext~, chi, in superconducting 2,3Qubit chip. [2021.02.19 Metal Team2-Final.pptx](https://github.com/bicycle315/QiskitMetal_HackathonKorea2021/files/7150796/2021.02.19.Metal.Team2-Final.pptx). 
We tried to target the properties by changing the design geometry. We changed resonator length, pad size, connection pad gap to target the frequency, anharmonicity and coupling strength respectively.
After designing, We rendered the design into hfss for resonance frequency and q3d for capacitance matrix.
